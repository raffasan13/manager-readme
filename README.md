### :round_pushpin: What is all of this about?
---
This readme is aimed to serve as a preview, a brief introduction on my management philosophy, my leadership style, my believes and what it inspires me to continue growing, and learning, and doing what I love and what I'm passioned about: the creation process of Digital Products throught the use of tools that contribute to meaningful innovation.

### :round_pushpin: About me
--- 

  * #### Background
I have studied computer science and I have been dedicated to Software Development since 2005 and lately I'have been a bit far from coding _which I really miss_, for management tasks, deddicating my time and energy to build that _mitic_ concept of "High Performance Teams" to real life.

  * #### Profesional Interests
  
Sometimes I feel the famous FoMo, _(Fear of Missing Out)_ referring to Tech Industry, so to avoid it, I really love to dive into trends and surveys about tools and most popular programming languages, new launching. I also love to learn from tech innovation and disruptive business.

Recently I was introduced to a whole new concept, _at least new for me_, and way to perceive and appreciate the art of coding, called Software Craftsman. That's the reason why I am starting to navigate into that wide deep perception of creating software that will become an incredibly and amazing and maintainable Digital Product.

  * #### Personal Interests
One of the activities that I enjoy the most, is cooking but if it is on a grill even better! I took it seriously, and I started to learn different techniques such as low & slow, fire management, cooking terms and tooling around grilling. At the end grilling is intimately related to software development, due to start creating from scratch, following a process of creation, certain techniques to achieve expectations and engagement from your users are needed besides, it will constantly iterate in the search of improvement.

I am a big fan of "Bricolage" or better known as DIY _(Do It Yourself)_. I love motor sports, specially Formula One. I used to follow soccer very closely but now only world competitions. Yoga is another of my "guilty pleasures", unfortunately I left it aside for a while, but I am committed to reactivate it in the short term.

  * #### People working with people
  I strongly believe that companies that care a lot about their collaborators are even most successful than others! The reason why I strongly believe this is simple: we are not robots or just "human resources". We are also emotional living beings with lacks and fulfillment, so I opt for cultivating a proper environment to take care of each other and grow together as a team.
  * #### Core values
  I will always pursue the respect as the base of the human relationships
  * #### Build trust
  * #### Motivation as a tool
  * #### Empowerment teams
  * #### Setting the expectations
  * #### Mindfulness and Wellness
  * #### Never stop learning
  * #### Empathy is not exclusive to Desing Thinking

This is a personal list of a few goals I want to start working on: 
  - [x] Start coding on RoR. Exploring also, <_Rubocop & Rspec_>
  - [ ] Dive deeply on Data Science.

# Sam's manager README
A readme on my management philosophies

## What is this?
This document is an introduction to me and an overview of my philosophies on managing software engineers. This document, like my philosophies and practices are subject to change and _growth_. In fact, I would be disappointed in myself if my views did not change and grow as I receive feedback, recognize patterns and try new things.

## About me

### Background

I have been coding in some form or another for 20+ years. I have been working with software engineers — pairing, thought-partnering, managing — in some capacity or another since 2008.

### Personal interests

I love self-teaching and improving my skill in crafts, including: software, woodworking, home renovation, gardening, cooking, bicycle tuning, beading, macraméing, knitting, script writing and acting.

I get major nostalgia for 1990s video games. I love commuter-cycling and I think every major metropolitan city should focus on better cycling infrastructure. More about me and my interests [here](./background.md).
