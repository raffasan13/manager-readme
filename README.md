# Sam's manager README
A readme on my management philosophies

## What is this?
This document is an introduction to me and an overview of my philosophies on managing software engineers. This document, like my philosophies and practices are subject to change and _growth_. In fact, I would be disappointed in myself if my views did not change and grow as I receive feedback, recognize patterns and try new things.

## About me

### Background

I have been coding in some form or another for 20+ years. I have been working with software engineers â€” pairing, thought-partnering, managing â€” in some capacity or another since 2008.

### Personal interests

I love self-teaching and improving my skill in crafts, including: software, woodworking, home renovation, gardening, cooking, bicycle tuning, beading, macramÃ©ing, knitting, script writing and acting.

I get major nostalgia for 1990s video games. I love commuter-cycling and I think every major metropolitan city should focus on better cycling infrastructure. More about me and my interests [here](./background.md).
